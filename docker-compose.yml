# Package, deploy, serve meteor application.

#   The packaging service requires centrality/meteor-build. Pull this image from
#     from the centrality docker registry, or build it:
#       `docker build --file ./ci/docker/meteor-build.dockerfile --tag centrality/meteor-build .`
#
#   Service workflows:
#      - testing (TODO): meteor-build -> testing + mongodb (--abort-on-container-exit)
#      - development: meteor-build -> testing -> packager -> runtime + mongodb
#      - production: meteor-build -> packager -> runtime (prod configs)
